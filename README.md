# AutoCars: Autonomous Traffic Simulation Engine
AutoCars is a multi-agent traffic simulation engine that models urban traffic patterns, vehicle behavior, and intelligent routing with a focus on collision avoidance using swarm intelligence. It aims to simulate realistic urban traffic scenarios, minimize collision rates, and serve as a foundation for analyzing real-world traffic patterns.

# Project Goals
Simulate realistic urban traffic scenarios.
Demonstrate effective multi-agent path planning.
Minimize collision rates using swarm intelligence.
Track and analyze simulation outcomes.
Provide a foundation for real-world traffic pattern analysis.
